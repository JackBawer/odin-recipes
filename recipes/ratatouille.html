    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       Ratatouille is a summer vegetable stew that originated as a French
       Provencal dish from Nice. Think of the vegetables that grow well in your
       yard, ready to be picked together in late summer and early fall — that’s
       ratatouille.     
    </p>
    <p>
       It's a stew of zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and eggplant,
       with herbs and spices and some onions and garlic usually thrown in for
       good measure. The coast of Provence is on the Mediterranean Sea and has
       a climate similar to California’s, which means the growing season for
       the vegetables in ratatouille are available for many months. You
       wouldn’t have it at dinner for New Year’s Eve, but you might have it in
       late October through mid-November.

        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato paste onto the bottom of a baking
            dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic. Stir in water and 1
            tablespoon olive oil until thoroughly combined. Season with salt
            and pepper.</li>
        <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash,
            red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer edge
            of the dish and working concentrically towards the center. Overlap
            slices a little to display colors.</li>
        <li>Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; season

            with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender,
            about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.</li>
