    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi] ⓘ) is a
       traditional Japanese dish made with vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi),
       typically seasoned with sugar and salt, and combined with a variety of
       ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, or meat: raw
       seafood is the most common, although some may be cooked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While sushi comes in numerous styles and presentation, the defining
        component is the vinegared rice, also known as shari (しゃり),
        or sumeshi (酢飯).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
        <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker
                with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will
                be added later.</li>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar;
                spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of
                cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and
                bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier
                sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon,
                cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom
                edge of seaweed.</li>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the
                bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut
                salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other
                rolls.</li>
        </ol>
